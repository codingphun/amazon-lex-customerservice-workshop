# Module 3: Integrate Amazon Lex with Amazon Connect
In this module you will integrate your Amazon Lex bot with Amazon Connect, a service that allows you to create software-defined call centers in minutes.

Upon completion, you will be able to interact with your bot using a telephone (yes, think PSTN).
To achieve this you will create a contact center, configure a simple call flow, and assign a phone number to the flow. 

## Implementation Instructions

Each of the following sections provide an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or if you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.

### Create a new Amazon Conect instance
Go to the [Amazon Connect Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/home?region=us-east-1) to create a new virtual contact center instance in the us-east-1 (Virgina) region.

<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1. From the AWS Management Console, choose **Services** then select **Amazon Connect** under Contact Center and then **Get started**

1. In **Step 1: Identity management**, select **Store users within Amazon Connect** and provide a domain name (e.g. `YourIntials-lex-workshop` to complete the **Access URL** and click **Next step**
	
	> The domain name used in your contact center URL needs to be globally unique and cannot be changed.
	Alternatively, Amazon Connect can use an existing [AWS Directory Services](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice) directory.   
		
1. In **Step 2: Administrator**, **Skip this** and continue with **Next step**

1. In **Step 3: Telephony options**, select **I want to handle incoming calls with Amazon Connect** and **I want to make outbound calls with Amazon Connect**

1. In **Step 4: Data storage**, accept the defaults

1. In **Step 5: Review and create**, review your settings and then select **Create Instance**

	> It may take a few minutes before the claimed phone number is active.

1. Choose **Continue** to get to the Amazon Connect Contact Center Manager App (CCM); poke around a bit to see what's available
	> If you accepted a call, it should show up under the Contact search option.
